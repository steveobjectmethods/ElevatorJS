## Elevator System Simulation in Javascript

This is an interactive elevator system simulation implemented in Javascript (ES6).  Its been tested on current desktop versions of Chrome and Safari and also Safari on iPhone 7 plus.

The type of elevator system that is being simulated has call buttons outside the elevators to request up/down.  There are elevator systems where you can enter a destination floor outside the elevator but this implementation does not model that type of system.

The user can click on up/down call buttons (the triangles) and these requests will be dispatched to the elevators.  The floor button pressed by the passenger after she enters the elevator is randomized.
